# 1. How to run the application
Download or clone the project repository from GitHub.
Open the project directory in your code editor.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

# 2. Libraries/frameworks used
For styling, I decided to use TailwindCSS. I kept the interface clean and minimalistic for ease of use. It is built to be responsive across devices, ensuring accessibility for users on different screen sizes. 
I opted to use plain JavaScript to handle logic and API requests, keeping the project lightweight and straightforward due to its single-page nature. If the project had been larger, I would have utilised a framework like React, but I decided to keep this project simple and lightweight due to it only being small.
